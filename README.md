# Weather_Monitoring_System
A Weather Monitoring System is an embedded system designed to measure and monitor real-time atmospheric parameters such as temperature and humidity. In this system, the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor is interfaced with an Arduino microcontroller to continuously sense environmental conditions and display the measured data.
